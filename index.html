      <h4>Hello.</h4>
      <p class="intro">I am a beginner-level Web Developer.I am nineteen years old and currently studying in Computer Science course at a university. Everyday learning and improving on my skills, keeping up to date with the technology around me. 
        I love coffee and also I am a big foodie.</p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p >I started learning HTML when the coronavirus pandemic had just begun. After practising it over since last few months, I have really liked doing it. I spend hours on coding and I find it fun.</p>

        <img class="css" src="css.png" alt="css image" width="25%" height="auto">
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Learning CSS can sometimes be really frustrating, especially when you are new to it. When I first looked at CSS coding, I thought it is like a cup of tea, but later when I got deeper into it I found out how easy yet confusing it can be. It plays a major in making a website look beautiful.</p>
